GenderPayGap
============

## This web application will be used to compare salaries of different genders with the same level of expertise and experience.
## We were able to obtain our data, based on these charts http://developer.dol.gov/expanding-growth/bls-occupational-employment-statistics-survey-oes#OE_FOOTNOTE

### Install these packages to allow the project to run properly:  
1. ` npm install express`
2.  `npm install express3-handlebars`
3.  `npm install body-parser`

After, you should do `node gpgmain.js` to have Node execute our JS file. Then you
should open up your preferential web browser and type in: `localhost:3000` to run
the web app locally.

3/36/2017 - added some fake "flash" error msgs via node sessions, handlebars and bootstrap, but the bootstrap layout is pretty hideous. I will use the idea however to make a different type of "flash" message.
